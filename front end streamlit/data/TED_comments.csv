Each chose their field because they were inspired by their predecessors. It’s therefore not outside the realms of possibility that any new works might possibly follow similar veins to the original. \nMusicians, like all other artists, create because they want or need to.

Progress now means not stripping the earth of all its resources whilst poisoning and boiling it.', 'I love this... we have a choice whether we are optimistic or pessimistic and this only reinforces my desire to be positive', 'That beard is optimistic.', 'Singing to the choir here, kind of obvious to me.  Leaders MAKE things happen, they always have.  Leaders are optimists, they have to be.  IMO, optimists are much more preferable to pessimists.', ""I agree with his message for idealogical reasons, but disagree with his actual argument, and don't think it would convince anyone who isn't already idealogically on-board. His core justification for optimism seems to be grounded in the assumption that 'things are always getting better and have been through all of history', but this is a very near-sighted and oversimplified read of the past. \n\nSure, by many, many metrics the human condition has been improving for the last few hundred years - but there are many periods of history where there are great backslides in standards of living, technological advancement and culture. Think of the bronze-age collapse, or the decline of the Roman Empire, or the age of colonialism in the colonised parts of the world. There is nothing inherently guaranteed about the continued short-term (next 50 years) improvement in the state of human civilisation. We could very well be entering a period of decades or centuries of decline, rendered an insignificant downward blip on the millenia-long upwards trend of civilisation five-hundred years from now - by those forgetting that the 'downwards blip' actually consumed the entire lifespans of billions of people.\n\nThis kind of oversimplified 'everything is always getting better' risks abidicating the responsibility we have as a species to recognize the real danger that our civilisation is in and to make immediate, radical change to avert that danger. I imagine that according to Kevin Kelly, the right course of action would be to just continue along as-normal without changing any of the entrenched economic and political systems which created the dangers we now face in the first place.

Well, only then and to realize it, you don't need to get on a spaceship to express yourself. It is assumed that the problem is another and has nothing to do with space precisely and for example. But of course, Einstein discovered relativity, and then it is assumed that they have something or a lot to do with another invention, such as radioactivity? And the atomic is nourished from it, and what is the result? The stars perhaps? Well, no, the stars are endless, they are supposed to be infinite. So what was the result? How many results are there throughout the life of an individual, many right? Well, you have to imagine then, the amount of results that have been, since the human being has intelligence. Perhaps there are more results than stars, boundless and infinite? How difficult it is to say ... yes ... no, or .... we'll see how it goes! I mean... we're quiet and don't cause... causes, please. Leave chance alone, Mr. Einstein, what forces are involved in causality? We observe everything and because of the number of results, it is believed that the human being is one of the elements that produces the most causes and also in his own environment.

Pero claro, Einstein descubrió la relatividad, y se supone entoces que tienen que ver algo o mucho, con otro invento, como la radiactividad?  Y de ella se nutre lo atómico, y el resultado cual es? Las estrellas acaso? Pues no, las estrellas son inabarcables, infinitas se supone. Entonces cual fue el resultado? Cuantos resultados hay a lo largo de la vida de un individuo, muchos verdad? Pues hay que imaginarse entonces, la cantidad de resultados que han habido, desde que el ser humano tiene inteligencia. Quizá más resultados que estrellas hay inabarcables e infinitas? Que difícil es decir ... si ... no, o ....veremos como va! O sea .... nos estamos quietecitos y no causeis ... causas, please. Dejad en paz a la casualidad, diría el sr.

Standing up against “toxic masculinity” is also standing up for men. Are women harmed disproportionately in comparison? Yeah, but that doesn’t change the impact of any of these negatives on the individual. A man suffers just as much from an abuse he can’t speak up against for sake of his manhood as a woman does from an abuse she can’t speak up against without being forcibly silenced. It’s just a power differential. \n\nEveryone is harmed by a social order that doesn’t afford respect to the equal humanity of every person. Full stop.

Иә, оларға мұның бәрі қажет. Бірақ Оларға шын мәнінде қажет нәрсе - өмір сүру үшін сенімді және тұрақты табыс. Сенімді табыс, тіпті айына 100 доллар болса да, оларға кедейліктен аулақ болу үшін өте маңызды. Кедейлік-бұл өте азапты. Оңтүстік Үндістанда өскендіктен, мен кедей фермерлерді көрмедім. Мен шамамен 17 жаста болғанда, бір күні ауылымдағы фермерді ферма ағынының жанында отырып,жерден бірдеңе жеп отырғанын көрдім.Не болып жатқанын көру үшін,мен оған жақындадым.Оның балшық жеп жатқанын көріп шошып кеттім.Қоңыр,бұлақтағы жұмсақ балшық.Оған бірдене болып қалама деп қорықтым. «Не деген ақымақ екенсін балшық жейтін?деп айқайладым.Ол маған шарасыз қарап:Мен егіншімін деді.Мен дәрменсіз кетіп қалдым. Сол түні мен мұны атаммен бөлістім. Ол өте ақылды,керемет адам. Ол Махатма Ганди жетекшілігімен үндістандық бостандық үшін күрестің бір бөлігінде болды.Ол маған қарағанда мүлдем таң қалмады. Ол аштықты басу үшін балшыққа күріш крахмалын қосып жейтин адамдарды білген. Ол маған терең бірдеңе айтты. Егер сіз шатырда аяқ киімсіз келе жатқан адамды көрсеңіз, түпкі себебін түсініңіз: адамның аяқ киім сатып алуға ақшасы жетпейді. Мен колледжді бітірдім, үлкен компанияда жұмыс істей бастадым, бірақ бұл оқиға маған қайта оралды.Неге 21-ші ғасырда Үндістанда әрбір 51 минут сайын фермерлер өз-өзіне қол жұмсап өледі? Мен және менің құрылтайшыларым Үндістанды аралап, оларды тыңдау үшін жүздеген фермерлермен кездесіп, алты айға жуық уақыт өткіздік. Климаттық қауіп егіншілікті тудыратын негізгі себеп екені белгілі болды .Бір маусымда ақылға қонымды ақша тапқан фермерлер келесі маусымда сәтсіздікке ұшырауы мүмкін. Ал жазда ерте егін өсіретін фермерлер енді жазда егін өсіре алмайды. Құдықтар құрғап жатыр. ,жыл сайын зиянкестер мен аурулардың жаңа түрлері пайда болып жатыр.Диқандар мұның бәрі Құдайдың арқасында деп айтты.Осының бәрі Құдайдың арқасында.Оған себепші – Құдай, жалғыз Алла.Бұл тұрғыда мен үміттің белгісін көрмедім. Мен оны дәрменсіздік белгісі ретінде оқыдым. Біз мұны фермерлерден естідік. Олар мәселені білді, бірақ олар бұл екі сөзді қолдана алмады: «климат тәуекел».Осылайша біз фермерлермен шешім қабылдау үшін инженерлер тобын жинадық. Ал шешім – жәшіктегі жылыжай.

Or it could be due to fear because the Russian woman was being recorded on camera, therefore, did not want to express how she really felt.\r\n\r\nAnother response from a different Russian woman was “what are we meant to do? Wait until they attack us?”\r\n\r\nThe “attack them before they use weapons of mass destruction” narrative was the narrative used by the western governments to invade Iraq.

Someone that is hiding in plain sight?\r\n\r\nIf the Russian Government has told the Russian people that the “tactical operations” in Ukraine are to destroy “weapons that are threatening Russia”.

The people will also told that they were freeing the Iraqi people from an “evil” dictator.\r\n\r\nThe Russian government also uses the rhetoric that it is “freeing Ukraine from Nazis” which they evidentially were not. E.g., Ukraine was a democracy where people were just getting on with their daily lives. Now it\'s a war zone!\r\n\r\nI’m an empiricist (science \\ psychologist) using a laptop and watching social media to gather probable facts. e.g., mainly “on the ground” video footage and listening to the rhetoric from the politicians,  political pundits & egotistical billionaire businessmen. so I don’t have access to the evidence to answer all the questions in this report.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will say one alarming evidentiary idea.

I wonder what you would have been saying about global warming when we were just starting to come out of our most recent ice age (20K years ago) and the Laurentide Ice Sheet was barely starting to retreat....sea levels were 350 feet below today....CO2 in the atmosphere was less than 200ppm....the earth's average temperature was several degrees lower than today....the Florida peninsula was three times as wide as it is now.....the Florida Keys did not exist, they were fused together as an extension of the Florida peninsula.  What was driving global warming the past 20,000 years before we started burning fossil fuels?   We are still coming out of that ice age now....the remnant of the Laurentide Ice Sheet is the Barnes Ice Cap on Baffin Island in Canada.   The earth is still colder now than it was during 90% of its history.   If we could stop producing CO2 completely today and begin extracting it from the atmosphere, the earth is very likely to continue warming.   Keep in mind the Greenland Ice Sheet has melted completely in the past and is likely to do so again in the (unknown) future.  This would raise sea levels about 20 feet.  Large coastal cities will have to be moved inland to avoid flooding.   NY city will have to be moved up the Hudson River toward Albany.  Despite this reality, I'm all in for trying to minimize CO2 production and for extracting it from the atmosphere as fast as modern technology will allow.

With the right policies and technologies such as Carbon Budget, Carbon Pricing and Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage(CCUS), industry players will be incentivised to act responsibly and Greenhouse Gas emissions will be checked and stay within its failure limit.\n\nAn optimal energy solution for Africa will be one that acknowledges the unique economic position of the continent in relation to the rest of world. As we make efforts towards energy transition, the trilemma of security, poverty and climate change must be thoroughly considered to ensure energy justice for all especially Africans."", ""Well done lads. I just hope they can cut ties with the Chinese government next. It's driving more and more African countries into debt traps and it has to stop.""]"

_P68Vkp-h7c,"['Interesting', 'i was 3 years old when my great grandma passed away. It was about 3 weeks after my younger sister was born and a couple weeks before my dad’s birthday. I remember being on my deck during my dad’s party and seeing her. I described her to my parents like this “great grandma was here tonight” they asked me to describe her “well, she didn’t have any clothes, no knees, and she didn’t have any teeth. She smiled and winked at me before going away.” At that age, I had no idea she had both knees replaced and artificial teeth. \n\nThis same great grandmother had spent a lot of time quilting. Over her casket at her funeral was a quilt she made, that she wanted me to have. One of my great aunts, her daughter, had decided she wanted it and took it home. She lived quite far away from us and had driven a few hours to the funeral. A few days later my great aunt showed up on our doorstep, quilt in hand. “This is Ava’s. I keep waking up in the middle of the night smelling death, she’s haunting me until I give it back” We took the quilt back and never smelt anything. It’s still in my bedroom back home.\n\nThe last instance with my great grandma. My grandmother asked me if I wanted anything else from my great grandma’s house before it was all sold. Me, being a 3 year old obsessed with horses, said I wanted a unicorn. My grandma drove over to the house, and sitting in the middle of the driveway was a red, glass unicorn. \n\nI don’t know if I believe in “ghosts”, I think I prefer to call them spirits. I know that my great grandma is my guardian angel and I couldn’t be happier knowing she’s always looking out for me', 'Great video !!!!', 'He wanted nothing and I wanted nothing 2 !
